Photograph your items and the outfits you create.\nSocks, undergarments, pajamas, loungewear and special occasion pieces (like your go-to cocktail dress) don't count. The capsule wardrobe is for everyday clothes.\nBonus points if you include hats, shoes, belts, purses, scarves, neckties,  coats, and the like in your total # of items count.
