Build a Computer,600,621.3916,"Construct a desktop computer from scratch with components that you have sourced yourself i.e. integrate a case, CPU, motherboard, power supply, storage, etc.

Also I am frugal and know it is cheaper to build source and build yourself than buy a pre-built system.","You can do this by yourself or as a team, but the computer must be completely built from scratch (you don't have to build monitor, keyboard, or mouse... just the box). It must not blow up when you turn it on i.e. boot up and get to an operating system of some kind.  

Expectation is this activity can range anywhere from $100 to $1000 depending on quality/performance of components you are sourcing + cost of operating system. I am assuming you will be purchasing a legit copy of an operating system. 

Bonus: Make it a non-windows O/S.

Socks, undergarments, pajamas, loungewear and special occasion pieces (like your go-to cocktail dress) don't count. The capsule wardrobe is for everyday clothes.

From Night Thoughts, by Edward Young:

""Be wise today; 'tis madness to defer.
...
Procrastination is the thief of time.
...
At thirty, man suspects himself a fool;
Knows it at forty, and reforms his plan;
At fifty chides his infamous delay,
Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve;
In all the magnanimity of thought
Resolves, and re-resolves; then dies the same.""
