Wardrobe should be seasonally appropriate - and you have to really work it. Photograph your items and the outfits you create.\nSocks, undergarments, pajamas, loungewear and special occasion pieces (like your go-to cocktail dress) don't count. The capsule wardrobe is for everyday clothes.\nBonus points if you include hats, shoes, belts, purses, scarves, neckties,  coats, and the like in your total # of items count. You don't have to. \nThe planner from Unfancy is great, but there are others out there, like Project333 (http://bemorewithless.com/project-333/). Find one that works for you.",
